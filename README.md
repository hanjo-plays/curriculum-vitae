# Oscilloscope gui

This Python program creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying real-time data from a PicoScope oscilloscope. The application is built using PyQt5 for the GUI components and matplotlib for plotting the data. The PicoScope device is interfaced using the PicoSDK API, which is accessed through the ctypes library to call functions from the PicoScope's shared library.

This project, in conjunction with the completion of the book "Python for the Lab" by Aquiles Carattino, was undertaken at the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology (IPK) in Berlin, under the supervision of Martin Hepper.
