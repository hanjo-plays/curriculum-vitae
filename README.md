# Cardio Resuscitation and Defribillation Robot

The task is to research the topic of robotics and develop a visionary concept for a future robot. The researcher must identify an area where robotic development is needed and explain why this development would be relevant. Areas to consider include medicine, exploration, research, services, and others encountered in laboratories.

The researcher should describe this robotic development and place it in a scenario that illustrates how and under what conditions this development or product would typically be used. This scenario should serve as a brief description, without dramatic elements, to showcase the practical application of the development.

The researcher must clearly classify the area in which this development or product is intended to be used (e.g., medicine, exploration, research, etc.) and give the product or development a meaningful name.

Additionally, the researcher should describe the tasks and requirements for this development, focusing especially on technical aspects. Components to consider include degrees of freedom, sensor technology, etc. The focus should be on the overall system rather than specific details. These requirements should be justified, and examples should be provided where possible.

# Oscilloscope Driver and Gui

This Python program creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying real-time data from a PicoScope oscilloscope. The application is built using PyQt5 for the GUI components and matplotlib for plotting the data. The PicoScope device is interfaced using the PicoSDK API, which is accessed through the ctypes library to call functions from the PicoScope's shared library.

This project, in conjunction with the completion of the book "Python for the Lab" by Aquiles Carattino, was undertaken at the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology (IPK) in Berlin, under the supervision of Martin Hepper.
